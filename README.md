# Analysis of Differences in Loan Amounts by Gender

Understanding financial disparities between demographic groups is crucial in various fields, including economics, finance, and the social sciences. This analysis focuses on investigating potential differences in loan amounts obtained by individuals of different genders. Using descriptive statistics and inferential tests, our goal is to quantify and statistically evaluate any observed variations in loan amounts between female and male borrowers. This comprehensive approach allows for a nuanced understanding beyond simple averages, considering the dispersion and distribution of the data within each group.

The analysis begins by calculating key descriptive statistics for both female and male loan amounts. These measures provide a summary of the central tendency and dispersion of the data.

## Descriptive Statistics

### Mean

The mean, or average, is a measure of central tendency calculated by summing all individual loan amounts within a group and dividing by the total number of observations (\(n\)) in that group.

\[
\overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}
\]

Where:
- \(\overline{x}\) is the mean.
- \(x_i\) is the value of each individual loan.
- \(n\) is the total number of observations in the group.
