Analysis of Differences in Loan Amounts by Gender
Understanding financial disparities among demographic groups is crucial in various fields, including economics, finance, and social sciences. This analysis focuses on investigating potential differences in the loan amounts obtained by individuals of different genders. By employing descriptive statistics and inference tests, our goal is to statistically quantify and evaluate any variations observed in loan amounts between female and male borrowers. This comprehensive approach allows for a nuanced understanding beyond simple averages, taking into account the dispersion and distribution of data within each group.
The analysis begins with the calculation of fundamental descriptive statistics for the loan amounts of both female and male borrowers. These measures provide a summary of the central tendency and dispersion of the data.
Descriptive Statistics
Mean ((\overline{x})): The mean, or average, is a measure of central tendency calculated by summing all individual loan amounts within a group and dividing by the total number of observations ((n)) in that group.
[ \overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} ]
