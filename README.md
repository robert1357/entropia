# Analysis of Differences in Loan Amounts by Gender

Understanding financial disparities between demographic groups is crucial in various fields, including economics, finance, and the social sciences. This analysis focuses on investigating potential differences in loan amounts obtained by individuals of different genders. Using descriptive statistics and inferential tests, our goal is to quantify and statistically evaluate any observed variations in loan amounts between female and male borrowers. This comprehensive approach allows for a nuanced understanding beyond simple averages, considering the dispersion and distribution of the data within each group.

The analysis begins by calculating key descriptive statistics for both female and male loan amounts. These measures provide a summary of the central tendency and dispersion of the data.

## Descriptive Statistics

### Mean  ($\overline{x}$)


The mean, or average, is a measure of central tendency calculated by summing all individual loan amounts within a group and dividing by the total number of observations (n\) in that group.

# Standard Deviation (s)

The standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion or spread of data points around the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability within the data. The sample standard deviation is calculated as the square root of the variance:

# Coefficient of Variation (CV)

The coefficient of variation is a normalized measure of dispersion that expresses the standard deviation as a percentage of the mean. It allows for a direct comparison of relative variability between datasets with different means. The CV is calculated as:

## Loan Analysis by Gender in Puno

After conducting studies on loans granted in the city of Puno, a sample of 30 male and female lenders was analyzed. The objective of this analysis is to examine differences in loan amounts between the two genders using descriptive statistical tools. To this end, various comparisons will be presented, such as tables summarizing central tendency and dispersion, as well as box plots that allow us to clearly visualize the distribution of loans. This approach will allow us to identify patterns and potential disparities in loans granted to women and men, and will provide a solid basis for assessing the variability in the data between the two groups.
